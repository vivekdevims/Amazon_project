## *Project Overview*
Analyzed a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform using PostgreSQL. This project involved extensive querying to understand customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. Through it, I tackled various SQL challenges, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also emphasized data cleaning, managing null values, and applying structured queries to solve real-world business problems.

An ERD diagram was created to provide a clear visual representation of the database schema and table relationships.

## *Objective*

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations

## *SQL Concepts Used*
Joins , case statements , window functions - Rank , Dense Rank , Lag , Group By , Having , Subqueries.

## *Key Insights*
High-Value Customers: The top 10 customers contribute significantly to the overall revenue, indicating the importance of customer retention strategies.

Payment Efficiency: The payment success rate provides insights into the reliability of the payment processing system.

Product Performance: Identifying top-selling products helps in inventory management and marketing focus.

Return Rates: Products with high return rates may require quality assessment or better customer education.

Seller Contributions: Understanding which sellers generate the most revenue can inform partnership and commission strategies.
